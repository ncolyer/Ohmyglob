# Ohmyglob

This really is a simple script for windows and nix based systems.

Syntax is as follows:


Usage: ohmyglob.rb [options]
    
    -s, --srcdir SRC_DIR        
    
    Set the source directory to be filed and categorized. (Typically your Downloads directory or cluttered directories.)
    
    -d, --basedir BASE_DIR
    
    Set the relative base directory for the output of the script. (Typically your desktop directory.)
    
    -?, --help
    
    Show this message


One final example: prompt$> ruby ohmyglob.rb -s ~/Downloads/ -d ~/Desktop/
